Naming conventions
==================


Mandatory
---------

* Functions / methods: `function`, `my_function`
* Variables / attributes: `variable`, `my_var`
* Class: `Model`, `MyClass`
* Module / file names / directory names: `module`, `file_name.py`, `dir_name`

Encouraged
----------

Keep all names as short and descriptive as possible. Variable names such as `x` or `df` are highly discouraged unless they are genuinely representing abstract concepts.


Spacing
=======

Encouraged
----------

* Use the absolute minimum number of indents of your code. You can achieve this by writing modular code, and inverting logic, for example:

```python
def something(args):
	for item_collection in args:          # 1 tab
		if item_collection.exists():      # 2 tabs
			the_sum = 0                   # 3 tabs
			for item in item_collection:
				the_sum += item.value()   # 4 tabs
			print(the_sum)
```

can become

```python
def something(args):
	for item_collection in args:          # 1 tab
		if item_collection.exists():      # 2 tabs
			the_sum = 0                   # 3 tabs
			for item in item_collection:
				the_sum += item.value()   # 4 tabs
			print(the_sum)
```


* Keep lines to 79 characters or less. You can achieve this by utilising other parts of this guideline, particularly with regards to creating modular code. Splitting over multiple lines is, of course, permissible so long as it doesn't conflict with legibility.
