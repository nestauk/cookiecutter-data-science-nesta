# Nesta Data Science Cookiecutter

_A standard project structure for reproducible and collaborative data science projects @ Nesta._

## High-level aims

- Shouldnâ€™t get in the way of rapid prototyping of ideas for an individual
- Analysis of one user should be runnable and reproducable by another user without changes
- Minimal computation and data transfer when rerunning the pipeline after changes
- Long-term integrity of the code-base without intervention
- Version control for data, models, outputs/metrics
- Reduce time to productionise analysis
